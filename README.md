This is a draft project to create a music player. I've had various issues with other players, and want to try my hand at creating something that fits me.

One of my major goals is to have very low latency between songs. I'd like to focus on audio quality and allow for the smoothest transitions between songs. Other media players don't seem to take as much care on this, so careful measuring will be required.
