# Starling

Simple music player. The idea will be to simply have a queue of songs and play them via pulse audio. Eventually I'd like to expand to other platforms. For the first iteration of Starling, I want this to be super simple and straight forward. Don't over-engineer it, but be conscious of performance.

Using QT as the UI framework. It seems to suit the projects needs for now, but I reserve the right to change this in the future.
